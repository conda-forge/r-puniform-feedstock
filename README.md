About r-puniform
----------------

Home: https://github.com/RobbievanAert/puniform

Package license: GPL-2.0-or-later

Summary: Provides meta-analysis methods that correct for publication bias and outcome reporting bias. Four methods and a visual tool are currently included in the package. The p-uniform method as described in van Assen, van Aert, and Wicherts (2015) <https:psycnet.apa.org/record/2014-48759-001> can be used for estimating the average effect size, testing the null hypothesis of no effect, and testing for publication bias using only the statistically significant effect sizes of primary studies. The second method in the package is the p-uniform* method as described in van Aert and van Assen (2019) <doi:10.31222/osf.io/zqjr9>. This method is an extension of the p-uniform method that allows for estimation of the average effect size and the between-study variance in a meta-analysis, and uses both the statistically significant and nonsignificant effect sizes. The third method in the package is the hybrid method as described in van Aert and van Assen (2017) <doi:10.3758/s13428-017-0967-6>. The hybrid method is a meta-analysis method for combining an original study and replication and while taking into account statistical significance of the  original study. The p-uniform and hybrid method are based on the statistical theory that the distribution of p-values is uniform conditional on the population effect size. The fourth method in the package is the Snapshot Bayesian Hybrid Meta-Analysis Method as described in van Aert and van Assen (2018) <doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0175302>. This method computes posterior probabilities for four true effect sizes (no, small, medium, and large) based on an original study and replication while taking into account publication bias in the original study. The method can also be used for computing the required sample size of the replication akin to power analysis in null hypothesis significance testing. The meta-plot is a visual tool for meta-analysis that provides information on the primary studies in the meta-analysis, the results of the meta-analysis, and characteristics of the research on the effect under study (van Assen et al., 2021). Helper functions to apply the Correcting for Outcome Reporting Bias (CORB) method to correct for outcome reporting bias in a meta-analysis (van Aert & Wicherts, 2021).

About conda-forge
=================

[![Powered by
NumFOCUS](https://img.shields.io/badge/powered%20by-NumFOCUS-orange.svg?style=flat&colorA=E1523D&colorB=007D8A)](https://numfocus.org)

conda-forge is a community-led conda channel of installable packages.
In order to provide high-quality builds, the process has been automated into the
conda-forge GitHub organization. The conda-forge organization contains one repository
for each of the installable packages. Such a repository is known as a *feedstock*.

A feedstock is made up of a conda recipe (the instructions on what and how to build
the package) and the necessary configurations for automatic building using freely
available continuous integration services. Thanks to the awesome service provided by
[Azure](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/devops/), [GitHub](https://github.com/),
[CircleCI](https://circleci.com/), [AppVeyor](https://www.appveyor.com/),
[Drone](https://cloud.drone.io/welcome), and [TravisCI](https://travis-ci.com/)
it is possible to build and upload installable packages to the
[conda-forge](https://anaconda.org/conda-forge) [anaconda.org](https://anaconda.org/)
channel for Linux, Windows and OSX respectively.

To manage the continuous integration and simplify feedstock maintenance
[conda-smithy](https://github.com/conda-forge/conda-smithy) has been developed.
Using the ``conda-forge.yml`` within this repository, it is possible to re-render all of
this feedstock's supporting files (e.g. the CI configuration files) with ``conda smithy rerender``.

For more information please check the [conda-forge documentation](https://conda-forge.org/docs/).

Terminology
===========

**feedstock** - the conda recipe (raw material), supporting scripts and CI configuration.

**conda-smithy** - the tool which helps orchestrate the feedstock.
                   Its primary use is in the construction of the CI ``.yml`` files
                   and simplify the management of *many* feedstocks.

**conda-forge** - the place where the feedstock and smithy live and work to
                  produce the finished article (built conda distributions)


Updating r-puniform-feedstock
=============================

If you would like to improve the r-puniform recipe or build a new
package version, please fork this repository and submit a PR. Upon submission,
your changes will be run on the appropriate platforms to give the reviewer an
opportunity to confirm that the changes result in a successful build. Once
merged, the recipe will be re-built and uploaded automatically to the
`conda-forge` channel, whereupon the built conda packages will be available for
everybody to install and use from the `conda-forge` channel.
Note that all branches in the conda-forge/r-puniform-feedstock are
immediately built and any created packages are uploaded, so PRs should be based
on branches in forks and branches in the main repository should only be used to
build distinct package versions.

In order to produce a uniquely identifiable distribution:
 * If the version of a package **is not** being increased, please add or increase
   the [``build/number``](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda-build/en/latest/resources/define-metadata.html#build-number-and-string).
 * If the version of a package **is** being increased, please remember to return
   the [``build/number``](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda-build/en/latest/resources/define-metadata.html#build-number-and-string)
   back to 0.
